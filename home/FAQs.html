<h3>How much does this service cost?</h3>
<p>There is currently no charge associated with the service. However, there may be charges associated with text messaging and data usage on your phone. Check with your wireless phone carrier for more information.</p>
<h3>Is it Secure?</h3>
<p>Yes, the mobile banking service utilizes best practices from online banking, such as HTTPS, 128-bit SSL encryption, PIN, or password access and application time-out when your phone is not in use. Only the phones that you personally enroll in the service can access your accounts. In addition, no account data is ever stored on your phone. And in the event your phone is lost or stolen,</p>
<h3>Which wireless carriers are supported?</h3>
<p>We support all the popular US wireless phone carriers, including AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. If your carrier is not listed when you enroll, select &rsquo;Other&rsquo; and try the Mobile Web option, or check back later, as new carriers will be added over time.</p>
<h3>Do I need a text message or data plan?</h3>
<p>Yes, a text messaging and/or data plan is typically needed, as data usage can become expensive without them. Please check with your wireless carrier for more information.</p>

The cookie is only visible by the Mobile Banking system and does not contain personal information. Some phones may require you to enable cookies or periodically erase them, requiring reactivation. If you are experiencing this issue, check your phone settings to ensure that cookies are enabled. If cookies are enabled and the issue persists, please contact your mobile network carrier for cookie support information on your mobile phone. If you would like to reactivate, text R or RECOVER to 96865.</p>

<h2><a id="Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>I enrolled my phone number buy did not receive a text message. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Typically you should receive a text message within a few minutes after enrolling, however sometimes mobile carriers experience delays which slow down text message delivery. While waiting, make sure your phone has wireless signal. In addition, be sure you entered the correct phone number on the enrollment site. If you still do not receive it, try to enroll again. If the problem continues, contact your wireless carrier to be sure text messaging is enabled on your phone.</p>
<h3>I received an activation code but never used it. What do I do now?</h3>
<p>Activation codes expire after a specific period of time (usually 24 hours). If you need a new one, return to the Mobile Banking enrollment site (called the Mobile Banking Center) and request a new activation code.</p>
<h3>What happens if I get a new mobile device or change phone numbers?</h3>
<p>If you get a new mobile device or change phone numbers, be sure to return to Mobile Banking website via your PC and update your mobile device profile in the Mobile Banking Center. We recommend removing your old device and re-enrolling your new device.</p>
<h3>Can I use Mobile Banking or Text Banking on more than one device?</h3>
<p>Yes. Visit the Mobile Banking Center and simply add another device.</p>
<h3>I activated Mobile Banking on my phone's browser. Why am I being asked to activate again?</h3>
<p>At the time of activation a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is stored on your phone&rsquo;s browser which allows the Mobile Banking system to remember that you activated. The cookie is only visible by the Mobile Banking system and does not contain personal information. Some phones may require you to enable cookies or periodically erase them, requiring reactivation. If you are experiencing this issue, check your phone settings to ensure that cookies are enabled. If cookies are enabled and the issue persists, please contact your mobile network carrier for cookie support information on your mobile phone. If you would like to reactivate, text R or RECOVER to 96865. If Bogota Credit Union supports enrollment on your mobile phone, you will not need to provide an activation code. However, you may be asked to enroll again due to issues with cookies.</p>
<h3>What if my device is lost or stolen?</h3>
<p>If you are concerned about misuse of your phone, contact your mobile service provider immediately to stop all wireless service. Additionally, sign on to online banking and disable or remove your phone.</p>
<h3>Do I need to re-enroll into mobile banking after I purchase a new phone?</h3>
<p>Yes. You must re-enroll into mobile banking after you purchase a new phone. Sign in to Online Banking on your computer and under User Services choose the Mobile Enrollment option. Enroll your mobile phone and follow the activation instructions.</p>
<h3>Do password reset requirements for internet banking affect my ability to perform mobile banking functions?</h3>
<p>This depends on your financial institution. Some financial institutions require that customers/members reset their internet banking password periodically. If you do not reset your internet banking password as required by your financial institution you will be unable to perform certain mobile banking functions.</p>
